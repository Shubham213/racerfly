high,19167,,And fill the board T head (red),High Grade Equipments,"Multi 2 S-6 S Parallel Lipo Load Table balance XT60 plug for RC battery charger B6AC A6 720i lithium battery charger part

Description:
This product is designed to simultaneously charge several lithium batteries (including Lipod, Life and Lion) in parallel. It is convenient to charge and balance six lithium batteries at the same time when used with a balance charger, which significantly reduces the charging time, since all batteries have been balanced at the same time instead of balancing the batteries one by one .
Characteristics:
ABS housing is fire resistant.
It can be used with all types of chargers (IMAX B8, UN A6, etc.) with balanced interface to provide balance load less than 6 lithium batteries (6 batteries of 2 S, 3 S, 4S, 5S, 6 S) that they have the same cells at the same time, which can avoid replacing the battery several times.
The total voltage is more balanced and the average voltage difference is smaller after the individual cells have balanced.
Compared to 6 times the individual load balance, once the charging time can shorten greatly, it has 6 times the charging current and only needs 1/6 with 6 parallel battery packs.
It comes with short circuit protection function (with 40A fuse).
It can supply balance load of 1 to 6 batteries (containing Lipod, Life and Lion) in parallel and supports 3 parallel charging plates to simultaneously charge 18 Units.
The XT60 plug supports 80A charging current.
It can avoid the overload of a single battery to improve the efficiency of the balance and balance of the charging cycle.
Specifications:
Material: Metal
Color: As the pictures show
Plug Type: XT60
For batteries: 2-6 s
Size: 14 * 6.7 * 2.5cm / 6 * 2.6 * 1.0 inch
Weight: 150g
Type: Remote Control toy accessories
Function: charging several lithium batteries simultaneously
How to use:
1. Connect the two ends of the 6S cable to the balanced terminals of the balanced charger and the balanced load plate.
2. Connect the power terminal of the balanced load plate to the output terminal of the balanced charger.
3. Connect the battery to the battery panel. Insert the balance head first and then connect it to the battery's output terminal.
Package includes:
1 x Parallel Load Plate
1x6 S Cable
Note:
The charging voltage of several lithium battery packs is the same as the voltage of a battery, for example, the voltage of 4 Units 7.4 V is 7.4 V.",8.4,,,,4
