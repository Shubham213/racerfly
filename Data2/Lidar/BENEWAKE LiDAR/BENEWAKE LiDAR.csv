Miao,1,TFmini,Benewake,"1. Compact 42mm x 16mm x 15mm module with 12m measuring range
2. Adopts multiple adjustable configurations for flexible use
3. With low cost, tiny volume and low power consumption
4. Great for Storage tank, robotics and other demanding applications

Basic introduction:
TFmini is a milestone for Benewake to promote the process of low cost LiDAR. It can be used as distance sensor,level sensor,range sensor, safety sensor for AGV, rangefinder,obstacle avoidance sensor for robot, tiny LiDAR sensor, etc. With its unique optical, structural, and electronic designs, the product possesses 3 major advantages: low cost, tiny volume and low power consumption. The built-in algorithm adapted to indoor and outdoor environments can guarantee an excellent ranging performance at a low cost and in a tiny volume, which highly expands the application fields andscenarios of LiDAR and lays a solid foundation for future ?eyes? in the smart era.

2. Adopts multiple adjustable configurations for flexible use
3. With low cost, tiny volume and low power consumption
4. Great for IoT, drones, robotics and other demanding applications

Basic introduction:
TF-Luna is the second generation of Benewake patented technology. It is the most cost-effective LiDAR distance sensors compared with the same range LiDAR sensors on the market today.

TF-Luna is based on Time-of-Flight (ToF) principle. Mainly used for stable, accuracy and high-frame rate range detection. TF-Luna's 850 nm VCSEL emitter (Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser) is completely no harm to human eyes. The product is build with algorithms adapted to indoor and outdoor environments and adopts multiple adjustble configurations.

It can be used as proximity sensor, range finder, level sensor, distance sensor, safety sensor, obstacle avoidance sensor for robot and any equipment. Because of the competetive price, TF-Luna expand the application to more IoT senarios.
