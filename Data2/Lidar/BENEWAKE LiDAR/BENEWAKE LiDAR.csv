2. Adopts multiple adjustable configurations for flexible use
3. With low cost, tiny volume and low power consumption
4. Great for IoT, drones, robotics and other demanding applications

Basic introduction:
TF-Luna is the second generation of Benewake patented technology. It is the most cost-effective LiDAR distance sensors compared with the same range LiDAR sensors on the market today.

TF-Luna is based on Time-of-Flight (ToF) principle. Mainly used for stable, accuracy and high-frame rate range detection. TF-Luna's 850 nm VCSEL emitter (Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser) is completely no harm to human eyes. The product is build with algorithms adapted to indoor and outdoor environments and adopts multiple adjustble configurations.

It can be used as proximity sensor, range finder, level sensor, distance sensor, safety sensor, obstacle avoidance sensor for robot and any equipment. Because of the competetive price, TF-Luna expand the application to more IoT senarios.
